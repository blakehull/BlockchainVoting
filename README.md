# BlockchainVoting

This is a very basic blockchain-esque voting application that I'm working on. 
I've built out the blocks and what we might call nodes, and began to describe the voter but I haven't created the polling stations.

This is a work in progress, and I'm trying to avoid using any service like ethereum because I'm interested in the engineering aspect for the nodes as well. This means making a bastardized/poor man's network.
